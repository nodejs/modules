### Modules Team

For the current list of Team members, see the project
[README.md](./README.md#current-project-team-members).

### Collaborators

The [nodejs/modules](https://github.com/nodejs/modules) GitHub
repository is maintained by the Team and additional Collaborators who are added
by the Team on an ongoing basis.

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are made
Collaborators and given commit-access to the project.

### Team Meetings

The Team meets bi-weekly on a Google Hangout On Air. A designated moderator
approved by the Team runs the meeting. Each meeting should be
published to YouTube.

Items are added to the Team agenda that are considered contentious or
are modifications of governance, contribution policy, Team membership,
or release process.

The intention of the agenda is not to approve or review all patches;
that should happen continuously on GitHub and be handled by the larger
group of Collaborators.

Any community member or contributor can ask that something be added to
the next meeting's agenda by logging a GitHub Issue. Any Collaborator,
Team member or the moderator can add the item to the agenda by adding
the ***diag-agenda*** tag to the issue.

Prior to each Team meeting the moderator will share the Agenda with
members of the Team. Team members can add any items they like to the
agenda at the beginning of each meeting. The moderator and the Team
cannot veto or remove items.

The Team may invite persons or representatives from certain projects to
participate in a non-voting capacity.

The moderator is responsible for summarizing the discussion of each
agenda item and sends it as a pull request after the meeting.

### Consensus Seeking Process

The Team follows a
[Consensus Seeking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making)
decision-making model.

When an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator
will ask "Does anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from the
consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a Team member can call for
either a closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next
meeting. The call for a vote must be seconded by a majority of the Team
or else the discussion will continue. Simple majority wins.

Note that some changes to Team membership require unanimous consensus.  See
"Team Membership" above.

### Merging PRs into this Repository

Pull requests must reach consensus in a meeting in order to be merged into this repository. Merging of pull requests must be decided during a meeting that has a minimal quorum of 50% of all active members. Members with observer status are not considered active members for the purposes of reaching quorum. A pull request that is is unable to reach quorum due to lack of consensus or quorum must not be merged into this repository.
