## The Module Manifesto

We the undersigned agree on the the following,

* Getting modules "right" is one of the biggest existential threats to JavaScript
* This affects a large number of people with varying interests including but not limited to:
  - web applications
  - serverside applications and services
  - command line interfaces
  - libraries and frameworks
  - transpilers
  - robots
  - art and music
* Getting modules "right" is hard because of these varying interests
* Creating a good developer experience is the number one priority
* The aim will be to not compromise the Node.js Developer Experience, but we recognize that may be necessary to improve the health of the JavaScript ecosystem
* While compromise is neccessary, it is important to recognize when Node.js needs to lead and attempt to influence change at an industry level
* The closer the Node.js and Web platform remain the better the developer experience will be

Without working together there will be no chance of a successful module system. "Together" is larger than the undersigned.
