## Agenda

## Announcements
 
*Extracted from **modules-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* esm: Modify getFormat and getSource loader hooks [#34144](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/34144)

Crux of the issue, example: an https loader having to make a request in `getFormat` to get the resource format, then again in `getSource` to get the resource
Having state throughout the 4 loader hooks may be able to solve this
Pushing a tricky GC issue to loader hooks that may not be able to rely on getSource always being called after getFormat (especially once chaining exists).
PR should delve more into edge cases and document exploration further, covering possible alternatives.
Make sure PR works with Gusâ€™s compositional loader PR [#33812](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/33812)


* Special treatment for package.json resolution and exports? [#33460](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/33460)
  - Refs:
    - add API for "package dir" [#516](https://github.com/nodejs/modules/issues/516)
    - up for debate on the placement (ex. `module`, `require`, `import.meta`)
    - proposed interface/method name: `resolvePackageRoot`
   - ex. usage, `.resolvePackageRoot(import.meta.url)` & `.resolvePackageRoot(process.cwd())`, `.resolvePackageRoot(__dirname)` (?)

* module: CJS exports detection [#33416](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/33416)
  PR has been updated to use a flag. Should we let the PR work stall at this point? - no active interest in pursuing any escalation for the block.
- Concerns raised based on heuristic not being fully accurate.
- Discussed alternatives briefly.
- Suggestion to use a loader to provide the feature to users for further feedback.
- Snapshotting of CJS modules does not support loader interception - agreement that a PR to disable snapshotting and allow CJS mutation to allow a loader would be preferable to not being able to support CJS named exports.
- Discussion to open meta issue related to group handling of these types of consensus issues.
