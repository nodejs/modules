## Agenda

## Announcements
 
* Discussion about proxyquire

- Christopher:
  - Module level mocking in tests is an issue with ESM
  - With common.js and requires and the cache you can do this fairly easily
  - There are various modules you can use such a proxyquire
  - It is nice to be able to just mock a module
  - ESM makes this difficult
  - I’ve seen some loader implementations out there that allow you to do this sort of thing, although I haven’t been able to play with them to figure out how sufficient they are.
  - One challenge, the requirement of using the loader flag at all. We don’t necessarily know if / when we are going to start mocking things. As it’s implemented right now you can only have one loader. If you want to use a loader for something like typescript you are in a tough position
  - Even with chaining loaders it puts a lot of responsibility on the user / test runner to manage this such as spawning a subprocess for every test even if the loader isn’t being used. Not very ergonomic
