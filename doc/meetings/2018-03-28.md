  - Presentation from Justin
  - Work done internally at Google with a number of stakeholders
  - trying to figure out how to get bare module specifiers working in the browser
  - currently you need to use the full path to the file.
    - arguably works right now if you are not publishing packages, but it doesn’t scale
  - proposal https://github.com/domenic/package-name-maps
  - package name maps supports scopes as a way to customize names -> maps
    - you can override for specific urls
  - currently mechanism to declare your package map is a script tag, inlined or external file
  - question about if this is sidestepping the need for “loader hooks”
